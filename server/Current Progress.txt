Clarify the differences of each files in server folder:
api.py: All endpoint implemented. I still need to figure out how to make the request working for the endpoints such as GET /Search.

The login/sign up function is working currently with Auth0. It just need to add the web url to the Auth0 application page.

I sent the email to Aaron, and waiting for response for the API request error.
